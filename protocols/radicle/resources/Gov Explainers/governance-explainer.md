# Introduction
The Radicle Governance process is revolves around the RAD token. Anyone with 1% of RAD delegated to their address can propose a Governance proposal. There are broadly two aspects to Radicle's governance process.

* Radicle's governance generally relates to its [Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://radicle.xyz/blog/integrating-with-ethereum.html) and the RAD token is primarily involved in this process. 

* The second is related to the [Radicle Link Protocol](https://radicle.xyz/blog/radicle-link.html) and its peer-to-peer stack, both occuring via an offcial RFC process. 

In this post, I will go into the Ethereum+RAD governance process.

# The RAD Governance Process
The governance process consists of four stages and should officially go through all four of these phases:
1. Temperature Check: This initiates an informal discussion related to a proposal idea and/or change.
2. Structured Discussion: Feedback from the informal discussion is used to document a draft proposal with a set criteria for a more structured discussion. This takes around 5 days, approximately.
3. Formal Review: The draft proposal is then handed into stage three for a Formal Review by creating a off-chain poll on Snapshot. This poll normally occurs for 5 days, approximately.
4. Governance Proposal: Once the governance proposal is passed, it is deployed using Radicle's radgov CLI tool. This should take 3 days, approximately.

Radicle's governance process is highly self-directed and reliant on its community members. Those that create proposals are referred to as "champions". Champions are expected to move proposals from one phase to the next with guidance from community moderators.
